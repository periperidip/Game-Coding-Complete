# Chapter One
---

Chapter One begins with Mike talking about his experience in the GameDev industry and what Game Development actually is.
- He talks about the nature of Game Industry in general and how the industry shaped him and the crazy work schedules the whole team goes through during the development cycle of the game.
- This chapter is not very technical but rather deals with the moral and psychological aspect of a game developer.
- Reading this chapter made me realise how hard a Dev has to work be it any industry so that the user gets a seamless and fluid experience.
    - One short note, something i noticed in the book, Mike states that making a demo of your software is way better than putting it on your resume as an ongoing project; a tip which I found really helpful.
- He then talks about SDKs (**Software Development Kits**) and their importance and a harsh truth that SDKs are taken for granted inspite of the fact that they are one of the building blocks of any game/software. Also stating that companies tend to modify SDKs as per their needs adn sometimes even requesting SDK owners to make a tailored version for them.
- Moving on, we see how the author applauds developing games for consoles because of the fact that there isn't any hardware variety in consoles unlike PCs which have a ton of different configurations for RAM,GPU,processor,OS etc.
- Mike then talks about the Dynamic nature of a game dvelopment cycle and how the ideas and designs keep on changing day after the other and rapid changes in the GDDs (**Game Design Document**)
- In  the later part of the chapter we see how QA (**Quality Assurance**) plays an important role in finding out the bugs and kinda "demotivates" the Devs after making them realise that the game they made is basically full of bugs and is sh*t, thus making the devs practically start over and fix the bugs.
- Moving on we see what is **Crunch Mode** , basically a form of exerting themselves to the max limit during the end stages of the Game Development cycle. Mike talks about how the office practically becomes the home of the devs and how they crush 100 hours of work a week until the final release of the game.
- Mike then talks about how difficult it is for the game devs to maintain support for multiple versions of an operating system giving the example of *Windows 95*. He then talks about how they have to write different pieces of code for *OpenGL* and *DirectX* as not all graphic drivers support both. There is also some talk about cross-platform porting of games and how difficult it becomes to port games from one platform to another conidering the large differneces between the platforms.
- The final word is on the fluid nature of employment in the industry and how everyone knows everyone because of how frequently people keep changing the companies they work for.Mike talks about how even 3-4 years working with a single company is considered a big feat.
- The **chapter ends** on the question, *Is it all worth?*; and in Mike's opinion it is beacuse of how fruitful the *Crunch Mode* is and the satisfaction they get when they see their game on the shelves of supermarkets and game joints and how people start making fan pages and give suggestions even to the minutest of the details possible.Basically how much they love the game.
