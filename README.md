Chapter wise synopsis of the book Game Coding Complete (4th Edition) By Mike McShaffry

This is a book based on Game Progrmming that I am reading during my summer break.
It also has contributions from David Graham,another Game developer.
I was suggested this book by someone and i thought of giving it a read as a part of my Game Development Journey.
Open to edits and suggestions.
